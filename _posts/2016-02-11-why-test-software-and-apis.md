Why test software? It is surprising how many corporations today, large and small, still ask this question. Testing is often misunderstood and therefore undervalued.

At its most basic level, software testing is intended to reveal bugs: inconsistencies or deviations from the expected behaviour. However "inconsistency or deviation from the expected behaviour" is a very subjective concept. It is not uncommon to hear that a tester had to fight with the product manager or developer about the validity of a bug they'd found. And that's the story you hear from professional testers. In many cases, a test team can still be made up primarily of support staff with little to no field experience, or knowledge about strategy of software testing. Even while this kind of team may be comprised of very intelligent people with vast knowledge about the particular software they are testing, without a broader understanding of why and how software should be tested, they are likely to meet with frustration and miss the real benefits of a sound testing approach. In order to reap those benefits, it's important to understand how software testing has traditionally been approached, and the skills necessary to accomplish basic to advanced levels of testing today.

A simple Internet search will show you many studies on the costs of fixing a defect late.

Businesses, by their nature, measure the value of a task by the dollars it brings versus the dollars it costs: the so called ROI -- Return On Investment. But calculating the costs of a theoretical defect released into production is only a guessing game. A simple Internet search will show you many studies on the costs of fixing a defect late in the development cycle, or even post-production. A look at news headlines will show the amount of effort large corporations have to invest in restoring their public image after confidential customer data was accidentally released on the Internet. But if buggy software is released, how do you put a price on loss of customer confidence, loss of market share, and in extreme cases perhaps loss of life?

Testing will never reveal 100% of all defects.According to Cem Kaner, "Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test." The information is compared against specifications, business requirements, competitive products, past versions of this product, user expectations, industry standards, applicable laws, and other criteria.

Each of these criteria may be given different weight. For example, banking software has to abide by applicable laws and industry standards first, whereas a video game has to satisfy user expectations above all else.
